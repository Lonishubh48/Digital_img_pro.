DIP 
Here in this project i created a function which is going to take the 2 dim array or image (which autamticaly read the shape of the image)
After that we make use 2d_dft function ( which is created seperatly) to conver you array or image into frequency domain for further analysis.
we make use of different inbuilt libraries to plot as display or result obtained. 
Here are the few glimps of our outputs:
